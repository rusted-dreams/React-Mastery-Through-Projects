# 01 BG-changer

- This is my first project on course of learning react.
- **A bar at the bottom which has different colored buttons which on clicked changes the backgroud color of the page.**

### Things learnt:
- useState hook in react.

### Setup Locally:
- pull the project repo
- `cd` into the 01 BG-changer dir.
- I use `pnpm` package manager. If you don't have `pnpm` just run `npm install -g pnpm` to install pnpm.
- run `pnpm i` to install dependencies.
- run `pnpm run dev` to start the project.
